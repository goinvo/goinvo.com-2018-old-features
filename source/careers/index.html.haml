            “My internship at Invo taught me how software actually gets planned, designed and made in the real-world. I got to contribute design for PTC’s Pro/ ENGINEER, working alongside many software designers with decades of experience. RIT taught me book knowledge, however my practical education happened at Involution Studios.”

            %p Intern or Seasoned Veteran
          %p We’re looking for a designer to join our intimate studio.
          %p
            If you’re familiar with our work, you know we design, build, and ship beautiful software for companies of all sizes, like Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, to micro startups. Often the applications require dealing with big data, involved workflows, information visualization, and competing business and design directions. We wrangle all of these variables, are hyper-concerned about guiding people through tough decisions, and produce eyebrow-raising results.
          %p Our idealized candidate can be described in this way:
          %p
            %strong> First and foremost
            , you need to be an exceptional designer: loving to design software, making is in your DNA, solving crazy problems with 50 different crazy solutions. You need to have a proven track record of designing apps that have shipped.
          %p
            %strong> Second
            , you need to be a system thinker and serial do’er: to see more than just the design and production tasks but the entire project ecosystem, to having a firm grasp of engineering principles and business practices. You will need to lead not just yourself but other studio’ites and clients. Your responsibilities include leading projects and, over time, learning how to manage the entire service (from development to user interface design to process engineering to staffing to budget to customer service), produce finished shipping designs, finalizing layout, color, typography, images, and icons, and getting your hands dirty in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other similar tools. You will not live in a production-only ghetto. Your ideas will directly shape the experiences you create. Ultimately, you will be your own business unit within the studio and grappling with the holy trinity: design, technology, and business.
          %p
            %strong> Third
            , you have to really care about Design, your fellow staff, and Spaceship Earth: being adrenalized about business, writing, open source, design, innovation, craftsmanship, fun. You are given great freedom and responsibility for managing your own work program to mentoring staff to driving company goals. Taking pride in and feeling responsible for a high degree of personal ownership in your work is critical because thousands to millions of people will immediately interact with your finished designs. We are looking for a passionate, inspiring, design-obsessed apostle who can increase our IQs (as well as dramatically increase your own).
          %p That’s the kind of person we want. If you have those three qualities, just about anything else is negotiable.
          %p If you have any questions about the position, please email me.
          %p To apply, send me your resume, portfolio, and phone number so we can chat.
          %p 
            Looking forward,

            “I love beautiful things. Being a graphic designer is something I’ve wanted for a long time. I never thought about designing software, but every day more of how I spend my time is with one app or another. The challenge of creating beautiful software is an exciting one, and I don’t think there is a better place to do that than at Involution. There is so much knowledge wrapped up in these people, and the great hands- on direction and assistance I’m getting really is a second education.”
