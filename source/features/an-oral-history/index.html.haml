						%span.full-name Andrei Herasimchuk: 
						%span.speaker-text I haven’t read that article in a while, and re-reading my comments on it, I’m surprised at how much I still agree with my younger self! In fact, many of my concerns about titles, job descriptions, and confusion over design and the tech sector have come to fruition. Having said that, I know I come off as overly direct in the way I speak and write, but I really was attempting to be as diplomatic as I knew how in my comments to that article.

					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: Yeah, there is still a lot of truth there. It’s funny, because I don’t generally like rough feedbacks and critique but I knew that I had the opportunity to learn a lot from engaging you so I did. At one point you told me that usually people didn’t engage because of your style but the learning was worth it for me.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: And the fact that you responded in a diplomatic manner earned you a lot of points with me. I was back working at Adobe in 2003 on Project Shadowland (which would later become <a href = "http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html?sdid=KKTJE&skwcid=AL!3085!3!50837904378!e!!g!!adobe%20lightroom&ef_id=ZqVPA4jz3GwAAAZ7:20140723194115:s">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a>), and I was in an environment with Adobe’s engineers where everyone was always direct and blunt with each other. It was a manner of working that I tend to prefer, as the work you get done is of a high caliber, but I often forget it’s not for everyone.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: True, but it is certainly common in the engineering community. Not so much among designers though! :-) It is a little-known fact that when you first came up with the <a href = "http://www.designbyfire.com/">“Design by Fire”</a> concept for a brand it was loosely around you, me, Ben Listwon, and Bob Baxley doing something undefined around it. I remember we had a call where the three of you were at your house in Sunnyvale and I was at my house in Toledo, Ohio and we were talking about that. Nothing really happened with it together but you took off with Design by Fire and it was really important in the global design conversation for a while.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: I was in the midst of doing a lot of product research at Adobe, not the least of which was trying to understand better how blogging tools, databases, and web technologies worked to see what if anything could work in Shadowland. As I usual, I learn by doing and I had been noodling with a Design by Fire logo and concepts for content focused on digital design trends. Initially, I was thinking we could write and publish a design book, and have a digital component with it. Ultimately, I just went ahead and built a blog with <a href = "http://www.movabletype.com/">MovableType’s</a> tools and hit the publish button near the end of 2003 without much thought into it, other than I have to learn how these web tools worked. That and I had a bunch of things I wanted to say to the world. In the first few months of 2004, I went on a tear writing and publishing all sorts of material, getting as much attention as I could from the early design bloggers who had already paved the road on the internet. I used my Adobe background as a quick means to gain credibility within the online design community, along with a few contests, giving away signed Photoshop and Illustrator boxes. A few key articles came out of that period, <a href = "http://www.designbyfire.com/?p=5">Gurus v. Bloggers</a>, <a href = "http://www.designbyfire.com/?p=6">I would RTFM if there was a FM to FR</a>, and the biggie, <a href = "http://www.designbyfire.com/?p=4">Design Eye for Usability Guy</a>.

					%p Andrei dropped out of Amherst to join Specular International, an early digital graphics company, as a founding member in 1991. In 1995 he left to join Adobe as their first-ever interface designer. In this capacity Andrei envisioned the creative strategy that resulted in the Adobe Creative Suite and built the Adobe design team from the ground-up. After leaving Adobe for a few years to work on start-ups Andrei returned to serve as the project lead for Lightroom in 2003.

						%span.speaker-text DK: Design Eye for the Usability Guy was definitely the high-water mark. Unlike you I didn’t have a center of gravity for my writings. A bunch of stuff was hitting thru my employer’s website but I was also making the rounds on the popular online publications like Boxes and Arrows, <a href = "http://www.uxmatters.com/">UXmatters</a>,and <a href = "http://www.digital-web.com/">Digital Web</a>. I was starting to speak quite a bit at conferences, too, and participate on different boards. For me it was sort of learning and exploring all at once, and my ability to communicate well in the process really brought up my profile, too.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: I was doing something similar, in that I was learning publicly what worked and what didn’t. How to write, how to be snarky, how to build MT templates, how PHP, Apache, and other web tech worked. I was learning completely out in the open, which is partly the ethos of Design by Fire. The brand was a play on Trial by Fire, and evokes a passionate fire within sensibility, both things I was deeply immersed in at that time.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: While the blog finally quieted the influence certainly continued. A few years later they <a href = "http://www.designbyfire.nl/">even started a conference around you/the idea</a> which I think is about as complementary a thing as can be done for one’s ideas. At some point when we were just talking about design theory I shared with you my desire to create a design studio. I actually don’t even remember doing it but I was sharing that with a lot of people at the time. Anyway, sometime later my employer was reneging on a variety of agreements around my compensation and an equity position in the firm. So I was sort of ready to do something else. Then out-of-the-blue you asked me if I wanted to do the design studio I talked about and do it together with you. So we did.

						%span.speaker-text AMH: Yes. Something that was going on for me at the time was that I was having trouble being back at Adobe but not being a part of the design team I helped to create. I felt too much like an outsider at times, and was somewhat unhappy with my role there. So after helping the Shadowland project for two years to the best of my ability, and not able to find a role within the company that could satisfy me, I asked you about starting a design company since you had brought it up multiple times in email exchanges and phone conversations.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: And don’t forget that Bob Baxley was involved with us on it for about five minutes! I remember the first time I flew out to meet with you and Bob. I think it was May of 2004. We already had decided to move forward - never having met! - and it was now time to figure out the identity and start really planning. We previously talked about the name Syntex Design as a name for the company which I think you liked more than I did. But along with Bob and your wife Donna Driscoll, it was on this trip that we came up with Involution Studios. That’s one of the three things I will never forget from that trip, sitting in the studio in your backyard and hammering through a naming exercise. The other two things are y’all driving me up and down the peninsula introducing me to Silicon Valley, and when my plane was flying into SFO. I had never been to California, and I remember looking out the window as the plane was coming in and thinking,“Hey, it’s the Pacific Ocean!” No, I learned later that it was the San Francisco Bay. But it was thrilling to be flying in, knowing we were going to start something that I was so excited and optimistic about.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Yeah, Bob decided he wasn’t ready for a startup gig, and lucky for him, he joined Apple right before the stock took off. So he did well enough for himself.

						%span.speaker-text DK: Of course, I spent the first year in Boston instead of Silicon Valley. It didn’t make a whole lot of sense from a business perspective, but my girlfriend was there and life is all about priorities, right? But actually, at the time I saw it as an asset because we could put on our website Silicon Valley and Boston. This was before working remotely was common, so there was some degree of gravitas to being in multiple locations, although in a perfect world I would have just been in Silicon Valley from the beginning.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: That first year was difficult for me. I had never worked solo ever in my career up to that point. Being on my own and trying to figure it all out while you were remote was something I had a rough time doing.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: Yeah, the first six months were especially tough sledding. We had a couple of really small - sub-$10,000 - projects and then the <a href = "http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> project that was from one of Bob’s connections. But even that was only a $15K’er. Thinking back it is remarkable we were able to get work and get momentum. We both had a lot of attention in the digital design community, and you had a lot of relationships in Silicon Valley. But neither of us were really selling.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Selling was something I still hadn’t gotten the hang of at all. I knew how to sell software, and I had done that with my first company, Specular, but I had never dealt with selling services or myself in a services capacity.It was all brand new to me, and the more I learned about it, the more I was glad that you had a real background in this area. I learned the hard way those early months of Involution that I’m a horrible salesman.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: Nah, just a creator at heart! So the big breakthrough for us was the Memory Matrix project.

Lou’s company was being funded by <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark">Jim Clark</a>, so Lou had real money backing him.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: I remember meeting with Lou, Alec, Jeff, Jason and Garrett at Alec’s house in Palo Alto. Alec was also one of the first Netscape engineers. Initially, Lou and Alec wanted me to join them, but I was committed to Involution. As much as I liked all of those guys, I really wanted to build a company I had a stake in as a founder.

					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: Yeah we were both ready to run our own thing at that point. Memory Matrix really did so much for us. Along with being a big chunk of cash it connected us to new people who would become future clients, and it gave us the opportunity to start bringing really good other people into the fold. That’s the first time we worked with <a href = "https://twitter.com/dbedingfield">Dave Bedingfield</a>, and he would go on to be in my mind our most important resource in the history of the Silicon Valley studio.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Bedingfield was one of our secret weapons. I had reached out to <a href = "http://www.shauninman.com/pendium/">Shaun Inman</a> to see if he could help us with building a Flash prototype of the Memory Matrix client so we could do some early testing and research. Shaun was busy, but he gave me the contact info for Bedingfield, who was living in Portland at the time. Turns out that Bedingfield taught new media at SCAD (<a href = "https://www.scad.edu/">Savannah College of Art and Design</a>) and was the guy responsible for teaching Flash to Shaun.

And I think <a href = "http://jeffcroft.com/">Jeff Croft</a>, as a little-known designer in Kansas City, was working on <a href = "http://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a> for us too.

Jeff helped us as well, on a few smaller projects, but not the Memory Matrix project. This was right around the time Josh was noodling with a few mobile games that would eventually lead him towards making <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla">Gowalla</a>.

				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: I think a lot of us had interesting adventures in our career duringthis acceleration of the web. The other big project around that time was PROTRADE. That came in via a friend of mine, connecting me to their smart product manager, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3854&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=OhSD&locale=en_US&srchid=7776351406149061543&srchindex=1&srchtotal=1&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A7776351406149061543%2CVSRPtargetId%3A3854%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary">Josh Crandall</a>. It was right in my wheelhouse as a fantasy sports game conceived of as a stock market. I was still in Boston at the time but they were in San Mateo so I started doing the bi-coastal thing. While my plan was to move out to the Valley after Fran finished graduate school PROTRADE started that process a little bit early.

				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: You’ve gotten a lot better with it, going to Europe seemingly every year now! I had a great time working on PROTRADE. I got along famously with the two guys running it, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-kerns/0/19/632">Mike Kerns</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ma">Jeff Ma</a>. My best day there was one where I raised some issues with the core game philosophy that had nothing to do with the software and UI. Kerns and I spent half the day in the conference room working through stuff. Ma was in there for part of it as well but what I remember best is that, at the end, Kerns said “This is the best day we’ve had at PROTRADE in a really long time.” And it was wonderful to hear because it’s why I was a service provider in the first place: to dig into really hard and knotty problems and kick their ass and make a difference.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: I wish I had known who Jeff Ma was at that time. We could have parlayed our earnings by a few multiples in a few trips to Vegas with him.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: Ha ha, no doubt! Toward the end of our time at PROTRADE they hired <a href= "http://svpg.com/team/">Marty Cagan</a> to be the new product tsar. Chief Product Officer or something similar. So, after that, my work fell under Marty. Now as you know my strengths were more down the creative director path than as a practicing designer. Before Marty joined there was a UI engineer I worked with who would basically translate all of my hand-waving and whiteboard drawings into a product. Well, Marty wanted to bring his own people in to do the work anyway so just tried to get me to kerchunk as much stuff as possible while our contract ran out. I still remember sitting in my office there trying to wrangle pixels, on the phone with you to get help. At one point I thought,“I run around saying Involution Studios is the best software design studio in the world yet here I am struggling to do remedial pixel pushing.” In retrospect it is funny but at the time it was a little horrifying. It did help me better find my place in the world.
				.interview-content

						%span.speaker-text AMH: I remember trying to help a little on that project, but I was so deeply immersed with Shutterfly that I had a hard time spreading my focus. Something I’m sure you’ll agree with is that I’m horrible at multitasking. I can only focus or work on one thing at a time. I felt bad that I was ineffective at helping out more with PROTRADE.

The product they had was built on a Java stack, and was utilizing a couple of libraries I’d never heard of. Andrei had already hammered out some great comps, so I had to get up to speed on a lot of material in a very short amount of time. Lucky for me, their office was about a mile away from my de facto coffee shop (read office) in Mountain View, so I was never short on caffeinated motivation.

We were brought in by <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/joel-nave/0/611/a28">Joel Nave</a> who really wanted to work with us. He is one of my favourite clients to this day. The senior VP, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajbhargava">Raj Bhargava</a>, was also there. We hadn’t met Raj before but he made quite the impression. He told us how the future of Agile depended on the redesign, and how much trust and responsibility they would be giving if they chose us. I had never had a conversation like that. Well, we ended up getting the business and that also allowed us to turn Invo into a “real” company.

						%span.speaker-text There was also a real sense of desperation in that meeting. The folks at Agile knew what had served them well for many years, but that things were changing and they didn’t want to be left behind. The opportunity was huge, but there was a real danger of missing the mark. So, yeah, it was definitely a first for me, coming from a startup background where there was little legacy and far less consequence to failure. It was exhilarating and scary.

Having worked with my first startup in <a href = "https://www.amherst.edu/">Amherst</a>, and having lived in that part of the country for half a decade, I knew a lot about Smith.

						%span.speaker-text BL: This was huge. Much like we needed the space, we also needed to grow the team. Part of that was just bandwidth, but the bigger part was having more voices in the mix. Like you said Dirk, we had a pretty solid three-legged stool going, but that meant that it was hard for any one of us to step outside the role(s) we were in. What was great was that Donna brought a whole new discipline of user testing and behavior to the table, and Tiffany was freshout of school, ready to take on the world. It is impossible to overstate the importance of either Tiff or Donna in Invo’s history.

First big project. Lasted... more than three years? Brought the core team together. Let us work across their company and from the C-suite to the real guts of the product.

						%span.speaker-text BL: Agile is still hands down the number one work-related experience I’ve had in my career. (Though I could’ve done without the couple thousand extra miles of driving we did.) The pinnacle of the whole engagement, and I remember this well, was the enormous ear-to-ear grin on Joel’s face after they did a presentation to a packed Oracle developer talk. After the talk was over, Joel told us how a couple of directors had approached him about incorporating a lot of the Agile work into other Oracle products. It was validation of all the hard work that everyone had put in, and he was justifiably proud.
				.interview-content

I remember though, there was this look on Uday’s face on one of the first days he spent at Agile, like “Oh man, what did I just get into?” In the end, I think that was because he dropped into a project where we were overhauling so much history that it would seem overwhelming to anyone coming in.

It was a bit of sheer terror in the beginning but ultimately Agile was a major defining experience for me in terms of diving into and driving “good design” in a wholly authentic, integrative manner, with a fabulous team and unparalleled camaraderie. Small personal bonus: having previously started my design career at Oracle in 2001, seeing the Agile UX being bought by and folded back into Oracle in 2008 was a bit of a “cherry on top” for me ;-) #sweetrevenge (But I didn’t say that!)

						%span.speaker-text: DK: One of the key things we did for Agile is help them develop agile methodologies. Yes, I know, it is confusing: the company is called Agile, and they were changing over to agile instead of waterfall. Raj had Andrei and I in to meet with him in early 2006 and gave us each a book about the lean manufacturing process. He wanted us to help him lead the conversion of Agile Software from their waterfall process over to lean. I was working that at the management and leadership levels while you guys were leading the charge on the product side. This was when agile methods were still not well- known so there was an awareness process as well as an educational one.

And he did, taking on a more artistic approach to the overall aesthetic that surprised me—in a good way. It was great to see him push both the work and himself in that way, something I love watching him do to this day.

I found myself applying variations of the box exercise at future post-Invo design projects including at Citrix.

					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Agile was the first place we instituted The Box Exercise. It worked so well with Agile that we used it for a lot of things later, and charged for it! Interestingly enough, the whole thing came out of a need to solve some team dynamics between design, engineering, and product managers on the project. While I had a rough version of the process with the exercise in my personal work or how to use it for a client, I had never formally developed the idea as a team exercise until we met a roadblock on the Agile project. The Box Exercise itself was something I would do on my own, in my sketchbook, or on a whiteboard. It is how I start almost every project I do, but I had never had to do it collaboratively, or formally. So doing the exercise in the open as a team, like the way we did with Agile, was a total experiment on my part. I’m glad to it worked, because if it hadn’t, I hadn’t yet figured out how we were going to help that team get through some rough early conceptual work for a total redesign.

That’s definitely not the kind of work we do so we banded together a lot of well-known designers from around the world to contribute some for us.

				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Spivot was my idea. It came about from messing around with CSS and RSS feeds at the time, digging more into Dave Shea’s work with the CSS Zen Garden, and first relaunch of the New York Times web site in the Web 2.0 heyday. Once you dig into how the separation of content and presentation works, the idea to take headlines and turn them into more dynamically presented content is a logical leap. So much so that the same idea became a big product 5 years later when Flipboard was launched. As it was, Spivot was a classic example of trying to do something innovative a bit too soon, as the technology to reliably fetch and parse that many RSS inputs was too difficult as the REST API boom hadn’t kicked in yet, along with web browsers still not having all the CSS 3.0 features needed to make a rich interface fully baked in.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text When I showed Ben the mockups of the idea, he agree it would be cool, and it could be something we try to build. In the end, it was just a bit out of reach in 2006 to pull off with our resources, and the tech was still not quite there for us.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.ben
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text BL: Indeed, Spivot was probably just a bit too early. What made Flipboard, Reader, and others work just a few years later, was a wonderful confluence of media companies finally understanding the digital publishing cycle and mobile devices making short reads not only possible, but probable.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text Andrei’s definitely right though, the other big challenge was balancing massive amounts of work on Spivot with keeping the lights on at Invo. The complex challenges of Spivot’s technology were very compelling to solve, but were an intellectual distraction from running the studio. It was a bittersweet reality that we had to walk away from pursuing Spivot further, but I’m always happy to see the concept validated by folks building amazing products that push the conventions of traditional publishing and consumption.

						%span.speaker-text: DK: One thing the foundation that Agile provided for us allowed was buy a studio space. In retrospect it seems wildly ambitious, but I had come up through successful medium-sized agencies that were characterized by their ownership also owning the building they did business in. My first employer and mentor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ken-lauerer/46/604/504">Ken Lauerer</a>, taught me that this was a great move from a cultural control and financial perspective. So I was keen on this sort of a thing. Ben, I think you and Andrei were fully on board with it too?	
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.ben
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text BL: I was, but it was definitely a big deal. Since the biggest thing I’d ever bought was a car, a building was a huge commitment. That said, it was a terrific thing for us to do. For starters, we needed a bigger space to grow within, but the real value was in legitimizing the business. For our clients, this meant formalized spaces for meetings and presentations, and crucially for us it meant ownership and control of what we could do within the space. As creatives, that’s the one thing we lacked in the Lafayette space, the ability to influence the built environment.

I loved the big sign, I loved the high ceilings, I loved everything about being in a real office that could house everyone we wound up hiring. So hindsight makes the purchase look like a risky move—and to be clear it was risky—but I’d do the same thing all over again.

I had met Dennis when he was still very young, and he and his brother Lyle were building Gamers.com. Being able to work with him, then getting the project with Lithium, Lyle’s company, is one of those things that happens so often here. It’s one of the biggest lessons in our business: Relationships are key. It’s how so much of Silicon Valley operates.
				.interview-content

					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text BL: I don’t think it was too much of an arm-twist to get Andrei fired up about working on something so intimately involved with gaming! Seriously though, the Raptr team was a blast to work with because they already knew the value of a great design. And, because they’d worked together multiple times, they were fast as heck at building things.
				.interview-content

					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: Dennis was willing to try all sorts of out of the box ideas and thinking. That made the project a lot of fun to work on. However, Dennis was still building his new company, so unfortunately some of the more advanced concepts had to be shelved because of time and engineering resources. While that part was somewhat of a disappointment, it was one of the projects I had enjoyed working on most in quite some time.

I remember meeting Dennis and liking his energy and creative thinking. We did the Box Exercise to break out the elements and structure... and I jammed on tons of wireframes and whiteboard sketching sessions before doing the pixel comps. I think that was my first true “consumer” design project, something that spoke to a very specialized audience of gamers. Fun times and cool project. Also where Andrei let me “run” it a bit which gave me more client engagement experience firsthand, Dennis was a great first run at that as he’s very gracious and accommodating client.

				.interview-content

					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: The McAfee project was probably Invo SV at its most potent. We only worked with them for about 10 months, and much of that was supplementary projects not the massive redesign. I think we actually completed the redesign itself in... three months? Four?

As had become part of our core practice, and one Juhan has kept going over in Boston, we helped to build the things we designed. On the McAfee project, we did exactly that, and plenty of front-end code that Rob had written found its way into the shipping version of the product.

						%span.full-name Ben Listwon:
						%span.speaker-text Yeah, McAfee was sort of the coming-of-age of the SV tech practice too. Rob and Tiff had really taken the wheel and I think the effort they put into really owning our development standards made it possible to meet the McAfee team where we needed to technically. They had a lot of low-level tech hurdles, and we had a high-level library of abstractions, so what could have gone horribly ended smooth sailing because of their hard work.
				.interview-content

We weren’t privy to all of the details but they had a remote UX team in the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle">Seattle</a> area and shifted instead to building a new local team in Santa Clara.

That was such a turning point, in retrospect. We planned that when things were at their very peak. And it was a really nice venue and event. Unfortunately, it was October 2008. We had more money in the bank than ever before. But I was looking at our big monthly burn and a non-existent sales pipeline, and I realized that with our large size we were suddenly and improbably in a very vulnerable position.

						%span.speaker-text AMH: Probably the best string of months of the entire thing for me was most of 2008, with all of our earnings, a full studio of designers, everyone working and kicking ass, projects humming along, doing great work... Then the worst month was probably October 2008 all of our major clients called us within a two week period and told us their budgets had been completely frozen. We were basically locked out. I had never felt so ill for so long as I had during October, November, and December of 2008. It was brutal on the psyche.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: We talked about what to do, a conversation that started while we were at the bloody retreat, and finally decided to try and weather the storm. I think we now both agree that was a mistake. But we worked hard to build up to where we were at, and the idea of following the classic advice - cutting fast and cutting deep - was a bitter pill at that point.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: It would have been too much for me to take. So rather than let everyone go and start over, we decided to try and swing around to making our own software with the people we had on board, while also searching for whatever client work we could get. Although in early 2009, everything was grim from a business point of view.
				.interview-content

						%span.speaker-text DK: 2009 must have been incredibly difficult for you, Andrei. I was off in Boston, only involved in the Silicon Valley studio in a very executive capacity. And over the course of the year the company just suffered from the economic conditions which made getting work incredibly difficult.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: It was brutal. But we tried our best. We spent all of the first half of 2009 prototyping and building up a few product ideas, settling on making tools for web developers. We got far into the project, and almost got funded, but in the end the deals never came through.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: There were some interesting projects down the stretch. Sean Parker brought you in to work with Founder’s Fund. And you were working with one or two other VC’s as well. It was weird: during our early years almost everything we did was direct-to-client but suddenly when there is little work and things are going sideways working with VS’s opened up as a new avenue. Albeit not one significant enough to sustain us.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: The lack of enough robust client work made it such that we had to let a few go every month the first two quarters of 2009. Not my best days to say the least. Looking back on it, I’m not sure how I managed to get through those times.
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.dirk
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text DK: It was such a sad way to end, and relatively speaking a remarkably fast fall. What do you think we should have done differently? Or what would you have done differently?
				.interview-content
					.speaker-avatar.andrei
					.speaker-speaks 
						%span.speaker-text AMH: I talked about the experience with Nancy Duarte. She basically told me that the only thing we could have done differently would have been to make sure our staff included 30% to 40% contractors. That way, when things like this happen, you can release contractors, keep your core key people, and do what you can to weather the storm better. Other than that, we were on track to build a great business, even with the expense of doing so in Silicon Valley, where salaries are high, real estate is expensive, and people still want to pay lower rates for consultants than is practical. The problem with being in the services industry—especially one that offers up design as it’s service— is that there are ups and downs in the economy, and you have to have enough money to survive the down periods when they occur. And they will occur. We were short on money by about 6 months, probably 9 months. But considering we built the thing from scratch with only $20,000 of our own money, it’s an extraordinary accomplishment that we built it up as big as we did in five years.
				.interview-content

						%span.speaker-text DK: By the time we realized the serious problem we were in I had already moved to Boston and bought a house. It seemed impossible not to follow through with the Boston studio as a result—the house was an anchor at that point—but in retrospect the idea of expanding into a new market while in that situation seems stupid. Could skipping that investment have saved Silicon Valley? I’m not sure. Even out in Boston it was Q3 of 2010 before we started to find our footing, the recession was just gutting. Regardless, the very idea of making that move in that financial environment doesn’t make sense.
