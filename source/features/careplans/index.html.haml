		%h1 The Care Plan Series
		%p Overwhelmed. It is how most patients feel at one point or another as they leave that sterile-smelling, fluorescent-lit doctor’s office. They have just spent 10-25 minutes being hastily examined, diagnosed, and, if they are lucky, educated about how to address their medical problem. They either leave the office empty-handed, or they walk out holding a generic pamphlet, which will likely end up under an unmanageable pile of papers or in the trash. Unless there was a major change in their treatment plan, many patients go home, forget what the doctor ordered, and continue on their usual journey of whatever harmful behaviors landed them at the doctor’s office in the first place. And without a clear, tangible plan for how to better their health, how are they supposed to behave any differently?
		%p There is a loose, under-utilized semblance of a "plan of care" in most health data sets. You'll find them mentioned in the standard Continuity of Care Document (CCD), the FHIR framework, and CMS's recent chronic care management code documentation. Yet, somehow no one really knows what you are talking about when you say the words "care" and "plan" together in a sentence. So, with the help of designers, engineers, and field experts, we set out to understand everything we could about care plans to then visualize our findings in a 3-part feature series.

						%p <strong>The third feature</strong> explores what these findings mean for the future of care plans and our shifting healthcare system, and proposes a call to action.
		%p Our feature series has three goals. We aim to spread both awareness to the general public about the benefit of care planning, as well as empowerment to demand such practices from doctors. We aim to inspire healthcare designers, entrepreneurs, and providers to prioritize care plans in their innovative products and practices. And we aim to encourage health policymakers to both establish a care plan database, and examine the cost of incorporating care planning into standard practice. Only in a new era of digital, standardized, adaptive care plans can we truly promote preventative self care.
