		%h1 The Care Plan Series
		%p Overwhelmed. It is how most patients feel at one point or another as they leave that sterile-smelling, fluorescent-lit doctor’s office. They have just spent 10-25 minutes being hastily examined, diagnosed, and, if they are lucky, educated about how to address their medical problem. They either leave the office empty-handed, or they walk out holding a generic pamphlet, which will likely end up under an unmanageable pile of papers or in the trash. Unless there was a major change in their treatment plan, many patients go home, forget what the doctor ordered, and continue on their usual journey of whatever harmful behaviors landed them at the doctor’s office in the first place. And without a clear, tangible plan for how to better their health, how are they supposed to behave any differently?
		%p There is a loose, under-utilized semblance of a "plan of care" in most health data sets. You'll find them in the standard CCD, FHIR, and mentioned in CMS's recent chronic care management code, but somehow, no one really knows what you're talking about when you says the words "care" and "plan" together in a sentence. So we set out to understand everything we could about care plans and documented that information in a 3-part feature series. With the help of designers and engineers at Involution and field experts, we examined how the concept of a care plan came to be and our understanding of it today (see <a href="/features/careplans/part-1.html"><strong>Part One</strong></a>), the current care planning process and limitations, and existing care plan-related services (see <a href="/features/careplans/part-2.html"><strong>Part Two</strong></a>), and finally, what all of that means for the future of care plans and our shifting healthcare system (Part Three coming March 11th!)
