		%p This piece is a continuation of the Care Plan series. While <a href="/features/careplans/">Part I</a> focused on what care plans are and how they came about, this article will explore how care plans are currently being used in the health space.

			%h1 The Process of a Care Plan
			%p There is not yet any clinically recognized universal standard for care plan creation and implementation. But using elements derived from CMS’s Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements,<span class='superscript'>1,2</span> the Coordinated Care Plan documentation from the Ontario Medical Association,<span class='superscript'>3</span> the traditional nursing care plan structure,<span class='superscript'>4</span> and the Care Plan Glossary from the ONC’s Standards and Interoperability Framework,<span class='superscript'>5</span> we have created a generalized care plan journey map below.
			%p The journey begins with a patient visiting his primary care doctor.

				%h6 Understand Health History
				%p The beginning of any care plan process, whether creation or review, requires an understanding of the patient’s health history. This should be summative in nature, and include basic information such as demographics, care team, vitals, problems, allergies, medications, therapies, notable encounters or procedures, and an indication of whether an advance care plan is in place. It is important to keep a patient summary up to date so that any care professional can reference it in an emergency.
				%div.circle.circle1 1
			%div.connect-box.connect-box1
			%div.process-box.process-box2
				%h6 Identify Health Concerns
				%p The next step is to identify what the current problems or health concerns are. This can involve reviewing symptomology, eating habits, physical activity, sleep habits, psychological issues, management of medication, sexual health, cessation of bad habits, management of any other daily activity, or any social or environmental factors on health. Collection of vitals might also be involved in the identification of health concerns.
			%div.connect-box.connect-box2
			%div.circle.circle2 2
			%div.process-box.process-box3
				%h6 Set Goals
				%p Goals are set to improve or resolve the identified health problems by the next review period. SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time oriented) help break down goals into smaller specific steps. Goals should also be measured in a way that’s quantifiable so that changes can be seen over a pratice timeframe. These can include both patient defined goals such as longevity, function, comfort, etc., and clinician defined goals.
			%div.connect-box.connect-box3
			%div.circle.circle3 3
			%div.process-box.process-box4
				%h6 Instruct and Intervene
				%p After the desired outcomes are specified, the interventions and instructions on how to acheive those goals can be delivered. Instructions are educational directions to the patient/other providers about how to care for the patient's condition, what to do at home, when to call for help, additional appointments, testing, medication changes/instructions, among others. Interventions are specified actions taken as steps toward achieving care plan goals. This can include adminstration of physical treatment, creation or adjustment to the medication plan, prescribed activities or community/social services, or removal of barriers to success.
			%div.connect-box.connect-box4
			%div.circle.circle4 4
			%div.process-box.process-box5
				%h6 Enlist Care Team
				%p A team of individuals should be enlisted in the care of the patient. The care team includes both professional parties who manage and/or provide care, including medical practitioners, nurses, allied health practitioners (physiotherapist, speech therapist psychologist, pharmacist, etc.), social workers, and care managers; as well as non-professional members such as caregivers, family, friends, and the patient themselves. It should be determined by the patient which care team members are granted access to his or her health information.
			%div.connect-box.connect-box5
			%div.circle.circle5 5
			%div.process-box.process-box6
				%h6 Specify Outcomes to Review
				%p It is important to set a specfic time for review of the care plan to determine whether patient needs are being met and if adjustments need to be made. Low level, relatively healthy individuals may only need an annual review of the care plan, whereas those with more severe chronic illnesses may need a much more frequent checkup. Specific metrics for followup should be determined based on the health concerns and goals set.
			%div.connect-box.connect-box6
			%div.circle.circle6 6
			%div.process-box.process-box7
				%h6 Live the Care Plan
				%p The most important part of the care plan process is how the patient implements it. They must translate guidance from their brief interactions with clinicians into sustained lifestyle behaviors to improve their own health. Self care makes up over 99% of healthcare, and it is only successful with a good care plan.

			%h1 The Care Plan Product Landscape
			%p As of January 2015, CMS transitioned Medicare to the more quality-based practice of reinbursing for care management of eligible patients with 2 or more chronic conditions. Now, physicians, certified nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are incentivized to perform 20 minutes of non-face-to-face care coordination services for every Medicare-qualifying patient each month. This can include tasks such as recording and coordinating patient health information (even from outside their own practice), managing care transitions (such as discharge from a hospitalization), coordinating clinical home or community services, systematic assessments of patient needs, and finally, the creation and review of a perpetually accessible comprehensive care plan. Now that Medicare has begun this transition, other private insurance companies are beginning to follow suit to prioritize consistent, preventative care facilitated by patient-accessible care plans. As a result, many care planning services have emerged to address the software needs of care management. 
			%p This matrix aims to explore the effectiveness of current care plan services based on defined criteria. Each service was scored based on the percentage of criteria met in each of the eleven topic areas. A 0 means that none of the criteria points were fulfilled. Click on each criteria at the top of the matrix to break down what subcriteria were used for scoring. The final score, out of 100, is the average of the service’s scores in each criteria area.
		.product-matrix
		.text
			%p There is a clear distinction between patient portal services (Bridge, Patient Fusion, Intelichart) focused on data interoperability, health history, and professional care team communication; and the less clinical services (CareZone, Healthtap, Wellframe, Healarium) focused on patient engagement, goal setting, and non-professional care team communication. Wellframe, CareSync, and HealthVault are the few services that attempt to bridge the gap between those two focuses, putting them at the top of ranking as the more successful care plan services.
			%p However, certain deficits seem to be shared by almost all of these services.  While interoperability is a growing focus, there still seems to be trouble in adopting a universal data standard for content and holding services to consistent clinical quality metrics.  Many services successfully incorporate data tracking and visualizations, though there is virtually no presence of actual insight from this data. Users are not receiving projected outcomes or recommendatons for behavior change based on collected data. Similarly, while users can access all of their health data, they rarely get to ‘own’ it. This means being presented the raw data for export, sharing, and personal documentation.
			%p These limitations, and others collected through secondary literature research are explored further below.

			%h1 The Next Steps for Care Plans
			%p Care plans have come a long way since their conception. We have created a somewhat systematic approach to a patient health guide, yet have not standardized it for consistant communication and delivery of care. We have established appropriate intervention steps for a variety of diagnosed conditions, yet have not mastered the format and delivery of these steps so that they are effective and engaging to patients. We have figured out collect massive amounts of crucial patient health data, yet we have not offered to the patient to carry with them and share throughout their diverse medical encounters. We are only on the cusp of health technology wave, and care plans have a bright future ahead of them. Want a glimpse? Check out our next feature.
