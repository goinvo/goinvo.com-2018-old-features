                %hr
                %p Clinical care, the focus of our health systems, only account for 11% of our overall health. However, it is necessary to view health as a holistic measure of an individual's entire living situation and life experience. These factors that strongly affect an individuals overall quality of health are the <span style="font-weight: bold">determinants of health</span>.
                %p Extending far beyond medical care, these factors can be used to improve health within the clinical, population, and public health spaces.

                %p Better understanding our own health, combined with giving care providers the right, available data and knowledge around a much broader set of health determinants, is the prescription for improved care and a healthier life.

                %p In the US there is currently no national standardized health record (SHR). Among the health records that do exist, they are primarily focused on storing clinical information. Using the determinants of health as a guide, an SHR that views health in a holistic way can give patients and care providers the right information for successful care.

                %p While our care starts with us, thanks to internet technologies we also have access to big data sets that provide insight for other people and communities. Not only does this enable more targeted public health interventions and policies, it provides the framework for following trends and even predicting outcomes on a large scale. Beyond having a transformative effect at a social level it can improve our own individualized health care.

                <h5 style="letter-spacing:0.1rem; padding-top:2rem;">METHODOLOGY</h5>
                %p The 5 main determinants of health (genetics, medical care, social circumstances, environment, and individual behavior) were chosen due to their consistency across the following 7 out of 8 organizations:

                <ul>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">NCHHSTP [1]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">WHO [2]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">Healthy People [3]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">Kaiser Family Foundation [4]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">NEJM [5]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">Health Affairs [6]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">Institute of Medicine [7]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">New South Wales Department of Health [8]</li>
                </ul>

                %p The 29 macrodeterminants and 66 microdeterminants below each main category were found by compiling the determinant lists of the previously mentioned organizations.

                %p The section below documents our analysis of the data and how we calculated the final impact percentages for the 5 main categories of determinants.

                %p The relative contribution of each of the determinant categories to one’s health was found using the estimated values referenced by the seven primary sources listed below.

                <ul>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">DHHS [9]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">JAMA [10, 12]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">Health Affairs [11]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">PLoS [13]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">WHO [14]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">U.Wisconsin [15]</li>
                </ul>

                %p Each determinant category was then averaged based on the values from each of the aforementioned sources (the methodology in the primary sources were different depending on the source. The final percentages should therefore be an estimate and not be viewed as absolute numbers).

                %p.remove_sentence_space Behavior: (50 + 38 + 40 + 39 + 36 + 45 + 30) / 6 = 46.33.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Social: (15 + 40) / 2 = 27.5.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Genetics: (20 + 30) / 2 = 25.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Medical care: (10 + 10 + 20) / 3 = 13.33.
                %p Environment: (20 + 7 + 5 + 5.4 + 3 + 10) / 6 = 8.4.
                %p The ratio for each determinant was then found by taking the average values found for each of the determinant categories and dividing them by the total determinant value.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Behavior: 46.33 / 120.56 = 38.43%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Social: 27.5 / 120.56 = 22.81%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Genetics: 25 / 120.56 = 20.74%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Medical care: 13.33 / 120.56 = 11.06%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Environment: 8.4 / 120.56 = 7%.
                %p Total: 38.43 + 22.81 + 20.74 + 7 + 11.06 = 100.4%.
                %p The final percentages are as follows.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Behavioral determinants at 38%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Social determinants at 23%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Genetic determinants at 21%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Medical care determinants at 11%.
                %p Environmental determinants at 7%.

                %p The following are updated calculations (as of AUG.2017) for the relative contributions of each of the determinant categories. The relative contribution of each of the determinant categories to one’s health was found using the values referenced from the six sources listed below.

                <ul>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">DHHS [9]</li>
                <li class="remove_sentence_space">JAMA [10, 12]</li>

                <li class="remove_sentence_space">U. Wisconsin [15]</li>
                </ul>

                %p Each determinant category value is an average based on adding the values from each of the aforementioned sources.

                %p.remove_sentence_space Behavior: (50% [9] + 42% [10] + 40% [11] + 45% [12] + 30% [15]) / 5 = 41.4%.

                %p Additional notes on the determinant category values: For source [10], The environmental value of ~3% was based on dividing toxic agent deaths (60,000 deaths. Toxic agents were defined as occupational hazards, environmental pollutants, contaminants of food and water supplies, and components of commercial products) divided by total deaths for that year (2,120,000).

                %p The average values found for each of the determinant categories were each divided by the total determinant value.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Total value: 41.4% + 27.5% + 25% + 13.33...% + 8.38% = 115.6133
                %p.remove_sentence_space Behavior: 41.4% / 115.6133... = 35.81%.
                %p.remove_sentence_space Social: 27.5% / 115.6133... = 23.79%.
