		%h4 Overview
		%p Health Axioms gives you habits to improve your health and well-being, literally changing your life. There are 40 cards. On the front of each is a beautiful illustration reminding you of a specific, healthful axiom. On the back are essential insights and tips that help you bring the axiom into your everyday life.

		%h4 Creation
		%p Our Chief Creative Officer, Juhan Sonin, was trying to live healthier. While he discovered an abundance of tips and resources on the Internet they were far-flung and temporal. While his doctor offered sage advice that also proved impermanent after the doctor’s visit and within the pace of everyday life. He needed something to take healthful tips and inject them in a more lasting way.

		%h4 Philosophy
		%p We are part of a global movement to shift the healthcare system to:
		%ul
			%li Non-invasive personal diagnostics
			%li Highly specialized clinicians that work closely with patients
			%li Self-monitoring, self-empowered patients

		%p Realizing these ideals is equal parts smart technology, healthcare reform, and everyday common sense. Living the Health Axioms focuses on the common sense part, taking easy-to-understand and realistic-to-implement practices that can become part of our lives in a sustainable way. The outcome directly impacts our health, is smarter for our lives, and is even better for our pocketbooks.

		%p It all starts with awareness. That’s where the Health Axioms come in.

		%p Released to little fanfare, the Health Axioms quickly took off and enjoyed viral success. Featured in media outlets like National Public Radio and talked about by healthcare thought leaders, Health Axioms are in use at a variety of hospital settings including in the clinics in San Mateo, CA, New York City, and Boston, MA. Along with requests for other form factors like a digital app and large, wall-sized installations, the Health Axioms in their current papyrus form are being enjoyed by healthcare organizations, clinicians, patients, and just everyday people around the world.
