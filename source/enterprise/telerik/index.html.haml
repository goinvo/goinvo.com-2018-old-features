	.projectDetails
		%p The previous <a href = "http://www.telerik.com">Telerik.com</a> website was the natural result of growth and development. The company and the website had grown in the recent years to house several product families that were divergent both in their individual product lines as well as the audiences that were interested in them. As a result, the website contained a massive amount of information that often resulted in an experience using it that was overwhelming, confusing, or distracting.
		%p In addition, the site didnâ€™t perform an adequate job speaking to the core values of the Telerik brand: quality, support, and innovation.
