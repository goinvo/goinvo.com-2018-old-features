		%p.caption Affinnova's Concept Studio gives marketing organizations a powerful tool to test and uplevel their marketing.

		%p Great marketing is the triangulation of speed, timing and great creative. Affinnova, founded in 2000 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) PhD&rsquo;s, uses patented product development technology to help their customers &ndash; marketing companies and organizations &ndash; quickly and radically innovate. Seeing an opportunity to help their customers further accelerate their innovation cycles, the Affinnova team prototyped a new Concept Studio. However, the complexity and power of the vision resulted in a prototype that did not have an adequate user experience. That&rsquo;s when Affinnova called Involution.
		%p We love complex apps, and the Affinnova Concept Studio gave us a lot to dig into. Starting with our product architecture process &ndash; bringing together our core design team and Affinnova&rsquo;s core product team &ndash; we refined the vision for Concept Studio. The subsequent design process birthed a dynamic application that fully manifested Affinnova&rsquo;s hopes for its potential. Prototypes were very successful with customers and the market.
		%p But it didn&rsquo;t end there. The crispness of the initial app enabled Affinnova to see more market opportunities, and we re-engaged to further diversify and expand the Concept Studio. Combining customer observations and feedback with Affinnova&rsquo;s deep understanding of who they are selling to and why, we extended Concept Studio in ways Affinnova did not originally envision. The result is software that won&rsquo;t just make Affinnova more money, in the words of their Chief Innovation Officer, they expect it to transform their business in fundamental ways. It has changed: Nielsen bought Affinnova in 2014. That&rsquo;s the Involution advantage.
