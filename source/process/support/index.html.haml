			%h3 Everyone budgets for the party. It&rsquo;s the next day you don&rsquo;t plan for.
			%p Once the project is &ldquo;done&rdquo; a new phase begins: Evolutionary improvements. Bug fixing. Customer service. This brings other parts of your company into contact with the product organization. It calls on your key team members to engage in a variety of design, engineering and communication activities, in order to keep the ongoing 360 experience consistent with the audacity of the vision we started with.
			%p Our team is accustomed to staying with our customers beyond the launch, often in a more part-time capacity, to take advantage of our deep experience being part of hundreds of software launches and the many knotty things that come after.
