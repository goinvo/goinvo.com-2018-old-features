			%h3 If you don&rsquo;t know how a product will be built, you should not be designing it.
			%p As a part of our concepting and crafting, we also help in strategizing with you on techniques and technologies to make your vision a reality. We give you the tools in terms of specifications and assets that your team needs to hit the ground running.
			%p Our build efforts span the digital and physical:

			%h4 Heavy-Duty Prototypes.
			%p Once lightweight prototypes point us toward a compelling solution, they can be used as a production tool. Depending on the project, the code may or may not be intended as part of the final production stack, but we write it with accessibility, responsiveness, and validation in mind. Our prototypes are coded to be relevant throughout the production process, serving as a visual spec and crafted with quality code that is leveragable by your engineering team.

			%h4 Development Cycles
			%p Some of our clients need extra design and technical muscle to enhance their production process. All or some of our team working with you can continue after the design has largely been nailed down in order to get you over the final hump.

			%h3 The Build process offers numerous benefits to your company:
			%ul
				%li Evolve your product into new languages and frameworks
				%li Exposure to our progressive, modular processes that can be integrated into your own
				%li Sharing latest theories and methods with our experts
				%li Outside minds and eyes reviewing the work
			%p Engineering is the backbone of every digital experience. Yours should be as strong as it can be.
