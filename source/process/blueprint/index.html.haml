			%h3 Architecture bring ideas and strategy to life.
			%p There&rsquo;s a long path from the right idea and strategy to the exceptional outcomes that have realized their potential. The complexity of digital ecosystems and the experiences within them demand not just careful planning, but smart mapping. Relationships, behaviors, and experiences must be juxtaposed for usefulness, usability, and desirability.
			%p The blueprint process itself is not sexy. Pattern design and identifying system relationships. Lightweight documentation. Review, revise, rinse, repeat.
			%p It is challenging enough doing this well for your feisty, garden-variety startup. But when you&rsquo;re redesigning one of Oracle&rsquo;s largest enterprise apps, or Medicare.gov, or McAfee&rsquo;s flagship Total Protection Suite, it is a design challenge of the greatest magnitude. Our clients come to us because we&rsquo;ve done it before many, many times. And they want us to do it again.
			%p Our architecture process consists of:

			%h4 Content Review.
			%p Reviewing anything and everything we have access to that pertains to your solution. When this work starts we need everything in mind, and we need our minds fresh. We need to see the holistic view so our solutions can be properly ambitious.

			%h4 Content Inventory.
			%p In order to create, we need to have a comprehensive list of all the areas of functionality, interactions, and outputs your solution requires. This happens to varying degrees in the learning and envisioning phases, culminating here with great specificity and deep detail in the early design. These are captured in giant format for our team and yours to validate. We do this exercise with your current product as well as for the future vision so we might get an idea of the shift that&rsquo;s about to take place and what&rsquo;s needed to make it happen.

			%h4 Flows.
			%p The main event: crafting all of the intended content into a system workflow will serve as the blueprint for all of the creation to come after. This exercise can also help to identify gaps in the workflow or areas that can be streamlined and made more efficient.

				%li Early schematics for your engineering team to work with
				%li Open process to get input from within and beyond your team
				%li Public sharing and socialization of our work together
			%p
			%p In addition to providing architecture for the things we create, the blueprint phase galvanizes your team around the structure and visualization of your most important digital experiences.
