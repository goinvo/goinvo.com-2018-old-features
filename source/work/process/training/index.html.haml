		%h3 As long as we’re bringing you some fish, let us teach you how to catch your own.
		%p Our core services are a smart investment for making great things happen quickly. Our training services are the long-term investment, so you can enjoy similar value without an external cost in the future.
		%p Training happens in one of two ways: mentoring and teaching as we work side-by-side together, or more formal training that may not be part of a larger project. In either case this is more than just getting a shine from our working together: we’re talking about a training process that is planned and designed to enhance the people you have. We give them the knowledge, experience, skills and tools to bring Involution’s excellence to your company beyond the span of our engagement.
		%p The way our training looks depends on who we are training:

		%h4 1-on-1
		%p When you have one digital professional whom you want trained they will learn from one of our experts, selected for compatibility.

		%h4 Training Small Groups.
		%p Small groups have different compositions and different needs; these engagements can vary significantly based on your specific situation.

		%h4 Training Complete Teams.
		%p Training whole teams engages a member of our leadership who is a digital thought leader, potentially including other Invo experts to mentor specific skills and tools.

		%h4 Broader Cross-Team Training.
		%p Our team size and composition can fluctuate greatly but includes at least one member of leadership with other participants as well.

		%h3 Training gives you the ability to create your own significant future value:
		%ul
			%li Investing in key employees you want to build around
			%li Preparing groups to adopt our methods in future projects
			%li Training whole teams or across teams to build exceptional organizational infrastructure
		%p Take advantage of our time and work together to upgrade the capabilities of your critical people and teams.
