			%em IS THERE CONTENT HERE?
		%p Our build efforts span the digital and physical:

		%h4 Heavy-Duty Prototypes.
		%p Once lightweight prototypes have us toward an appropriate solution we shift into making that prototype better-suited for being an appropriate production tool. Depending on the project the code may or may not be intended as part of the final production stack. It is written to be relevant throughout the production process, serving as a visual spec and crafted with quality code that is leveragable by your engineering org.

		%h4 Production Code
		%p Some of our clients need extra design and technical muscle to enhance their production process. All or some of our team working with you can continue after the design has largely been nailed down in order to get you over the final hump.

		%h4 Fabricating.
		%p For hardware and digital environments work, our team builds models and prototypes to validate the design and provide a spec for the manufacturer.

		%h4 QA.
		%p Outside eyes are invaluable during the production process. Especially if they are part of the project but not deep in the weeds of getting it built.

		%h3 The Build process offers numerous benefits to your company:
		%ul
			%li Evolve your product into new languages and frameworks
			%li Exposure to our progressive, modular processes that can be integrated into your own
			%li Sharing latest theories and methods with our experts
			%li Outside minds and eyes reviewing the work
		%p Engineering is the backbone of every digital experience. Yours should be as strong as it can be.
