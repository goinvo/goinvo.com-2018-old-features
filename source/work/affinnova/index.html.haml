		%p.caption Affinnova's Concept Studio gives marketing organizations a powerful tool to test and uplevel their marketing.
		%p Great marketing is the triangulation of speed, timing and great creative. Affinnova, founded in 2000 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) PhD’s, uses patented product development technology to help their customers – marketing companies and organizations – quickly and radically innovate. Seeing an opportunity to help their customers further accelerate their innovation cycles, the Affinnova team prototyped a new Concept Studio. However, the complexity and power of the vision resulted in a prototype that did not have an adequate user experience. That’s when Affinnova called Involution.
		%p We love complex apps, and the Affinnova Concept Studio gave us a lot to dig into. Starting with our product architecture process – bringing together our core design team and Affinnova’s core product team – we refined the vision for Concept Studio. The subsequent design process birthed a dynamic application that fully manifested Affinnova’s hopes for its potential. Prototypes were very successful with customers and the market.
		%p But it didn’t end there. The crispness of the initial app enabled Affinnova to see more market opportunities, and we re-engaged to further diversify and expand the Concept Studio. Combining customer observations and feedback with Affinnova’s deep understanding of who they are selling to and why, we extended Concept Studio in ways Affinnova did not originally envision. The result is software that won’t just make Affinnova more money, in the words of their Chief Innovation Officer, they expect it to transform their business in fundamental ways. That’s the Involution advantage.
